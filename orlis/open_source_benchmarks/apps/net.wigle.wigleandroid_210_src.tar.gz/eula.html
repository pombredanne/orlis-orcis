      ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR THE DATA EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING 
      BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS 
      FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. ALL SUCH WARRANTIES ARE EXPRESSLY AND SPECIFICALLY

    <p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="-1">GENERAL. This Agreement constitutes 
      the entire Agreement between you and WiGLE. This Agreement shall be governed 
      and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois. WiGLE 
      reserves all rights not expressly granted. In the event of litigation, the 
      prevailing party is entitled to full costs and appropriate relief. Waiver 
      of any breach by WiGLE is not considered to be a waiver of any other breach. 
      The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if any one or more are 
      judicially determined to be illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, 
      the remaining provisions or portions shall remain binding. WiGLE considers 
      this data to be a unique and valuable asset and has the right to seek whatever 
      equitable and legal redress which may be available for your breach of this 
      license.</font></p>
