# Calendar Color

A simple open source app to change to color of a calendar in android 4+.
Tested with calendars provided by [ba√Økal](http://baikal-server.com/).

# Issues

**The color is slightly different from what the google calendar app is showing.**
The google calendar app seems to tweak the colors a little bit. Colors set in owncloud are also slightly different in the google calendar app.

**The color changes back after some time**
Many calendar services will overwrite the color when syncing. Set the color directly in the service (e.g. google, owncloud) instead.
