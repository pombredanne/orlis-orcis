# OSRSHelper

Do you sometimes feel the urgent need to look up your total level or your daily gainz on Old School Runescape, but cannot because you're away from the computer? How many times have you missed that golden opportunity to show that girl at the bar that you have over 1k total levels, and that you once gained 1.4m cooking experience in a single day? 

We solved that problem for you. You can now consult your tracker experience and your hiscores from this new app, and it's super fast.
