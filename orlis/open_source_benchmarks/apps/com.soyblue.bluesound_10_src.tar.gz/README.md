# BlueSound
Android application to redirect audio to Bluetooth headset. Some Bluetooth enabled cars enable only voice to go over Bluetooth, but you may want to stream audio music. This app does just that. There are a lot of Android application in the market for this, but I failed to find one without adds so I wrote one. It is public on the Android Play store for Free to download.

THIS APP IS FREE AS IN BEER!!!! No atribution, no nothing. Public Domain. Do what ever you want with it, I do not care.
