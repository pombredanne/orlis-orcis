    <string name="help_title">How to use DailybRead</string>
    <string name="help_text">
        DailybRead is an app that uses the OpenLibrary API to find random books
        for you to read and download.\n\n
        It also allows you to search through OpenLibrary\'s database for any books you are interested in.\n\n
        The app is separated into the following sections:\n\n
        \n
        <b>- Today\'s bRead -</b>\n\n
        The featured section of the app that searches for random books to read based on a random search query.\n\n
        You\'ll find that some interesting books will come up using this feature.\n\n
        You can view the random book and choose to download it if you like.\n\n
        If you want to search for a new random book, simply open the menu and press \'Get new bRead\'.\n\n
        For information on the book currently being viewed, press the info icon from the action bar or menu.\n\n
        To download a book, press the download icon from the action bar or menu.\n\n
        To view this help dialog, press the help icon from the action bar or menu.\n\n
        You can close the app any time by pressing \'Quit\' from the menu.\n\n
        \n
        <b>- Search -</b>\n\n
        This section allows you to do a quick search on all the books in OpenLibrary.\n\n
        Simply enter the search criteria you want to use and press \'Search\' at the bottom of the screen.\n\n
        A list of results with cover images (if available), title, author and year first published will be
        presented.\n\n
        Selecting a result from the list will attempt to download and show the ebook.\n\n
        If the app is unable to get the ebook, the book\'s page on OpenLibrary will be opened in your browser.\n\n
        \n
        <b>- Saved Books -</b>\n\n
        This section allows you to view and open any books you have saved from within DailybRead.\n\n
        Books are saved to your SD card in the \'Books\' folder.\n\n
        Note: if you wish, you may place epub files in this folder and view them within DailybRead.\n\n
        \n
