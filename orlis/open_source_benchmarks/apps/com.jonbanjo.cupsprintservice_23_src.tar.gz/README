This app is licensed under GPLv3+ -- see LICENSE file. Original development by
Jon Freeman <http://mobd.jonbanjo.com/jfcupsprintservice/>, adaption to gradle
by Boris Kraut.

While this project builds and installs fine, the functionality is untested. I
updated and cleaned the project because I wanted to know more about the
PrinterService. Hopefully someone experienced will pick up where Jon left and
provide Android with a free/libre/open-source interface to CUPS or other IPP
printers.

Used libraries:
* JfCups (based on Cups4j)
* JmDNS 3.4.1
* Ini4J 0.5.4
* Apache Commons-Validator 1.4.0
* Android support libraries
