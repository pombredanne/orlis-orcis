# WikipOff

## About
This app is an offline [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) reader. Its purpose is to help anyone with a few Gb of space on their android storage to be always right in arguments, whether or not they have a dataplan.

# WARNING

I am not:
- an Android developer
- a Java developer
- a developer.

Everything here has mostly been written by copy-pasting code from stackoverflow.com and bashing ctrl-space shortcut in Eclipse.

## Getting Started
1. `git clone https://github.com/conchyliculture/wikipoff.git`
2. Add project in eclipse
3. Manage to make it work and compile and stuff
4. Rage because it's a huge PIA to build anything from source in any of the hype IDEs.
5. Download some already available wikis from the app, or [Build one yourself](https://github.com/conchyliculture/wikipoff-tools).
6. enjoy

## License
GPLv3. Get it, hack it, compile it, share it.

## Why
I was used to have [WikiDroyd](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.osa.android.wikidroyd) for winning arguments and to have something to read when I don't have my ebook reader.
Unfortunately, the app isn't compatible with my [ParanoidAndroid](http://paranoidandroid.co/roms/mako/) ROM without Gapps. 
There are tons of offline readers on Google Playstore, but not on F-Droid. I would have had to get the corresponding APK (some are 4Gb because they ship with the whole database...), test them, check if I could update my own DB, etc.
It looked easier/funnier to make my own app.
