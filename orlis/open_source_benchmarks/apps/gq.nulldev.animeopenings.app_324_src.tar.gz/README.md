# animeopenings-android
Native android client for openings.moe! (http://nulldev.xyz/apps/)

Original 'openings.moe' by AniDev: https://github.com/AniDevTwitter/animeopenings

# Features
- Very basic subtitle support
- Playlist builder
- Easter eggs
- Background and screen-off play
- All other features included in web version
- Gesture controls

# Status
Dev version (version in repo) is currently almost a complete rewrite of the old app and is very buggy.
If you are actually going to use this, I recommend downloading the release version instead.

# TODO List
- Fix all bugs in new dev version
- Background playing with notification controls
- Better subtitle support
- Video caching

# Download
The release version can be downloaded at: http://nulldev.xyz/apps/

The development versions can be downloaded at: http://cirelease.nulldev.xyz/build/ (Just get the one that ends in the biggest number)

# Dependencies
AnimeOpenings uses OkHttp (https://github.com/square/okhttp) to fetch subtitles and a modified version of SubtitleSeeker (https://github.com/null-dev/SubtitleSeeker) to sync the subtitles to the MediaPlayer.
