# Diaspora Native WebApp

### About
This is an unofficial client developed just for the lulz.
It's currently under development and should be used with that in mind. Please submit any bugs you might find.

### License
It's released under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (see LICENCE).

### Native
It's "native" because it's developed in Java + the Android SDK (Android Studio).
Other Diaspora clients are developed using frameworks like AppCelerator Titanium. A native app will always be more efficient and 
almost certainly be faster and make better use of the resources of the device.

### "WebApp"
It's a WebApp because at this moment Diaspora doesn't have an API that can be used to create a native interface to retrieve the 
user's data, publications, direct messages and so on, that's why there are only WebApps for Diaspora out there.

### Why a WebApp is better than using the mobile site on a browser?
Basically it provides better integration with the system (events coming into and going out of the app), notifications, 
customized interface and functions and a nice little icon that takes you directly to your favorite social network :)

### System Requirements
The minimum version supported is Ice Cream Sandwitch, Android version 4.0.3 (or API 15)

### Permissions
It requires access to the Internet and to external storage to be able to upload photos when creating a new post.

### Third party libraries
I use the following third party libraries:
