Stars
Alpha Crateris, traditionally called Alkes, is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 4.1, 174 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means "the cup". Beta Crateris is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 4.5, 266 light-years from Earth. Gamma Crateris is a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a white star of magnitude 4.1, 84 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 9.6. Delta Crateris is the brightest star in Crater at magnitude 3.6. 195 light-years away, it is an orange-hued giant star.
R Crateris is a semi-regular variable of type SRb and a spectral classification of M7. It has a magnitude of 9.8-11.2 and an optical period of 160 days.
SZ Crateris is a magnitude 8.1 variable star. It is a nearby star system located about 44 light years from the Sun. It is also identified as Gliese 425, and in the past it was known as Abt's Star.[citation needed]
31 Crateris (now regarded as part of Corvus) is a 5.2 magnitude star which was once mistaken for a moon of Mercury.

Mythology
Corvus, Crater and other constellations seen around Hydra. From Urania's Mirror (1825)
Crater is identified with a story from Greek mythology in which a crow or raven serves Apollo, and is sent to fetch water, but it rests lazily on the journey, and after finally obtaining the water in a cup, takes back a water snake as an excuse. According to the myth, Apollo saw through the fraud, and angrily cast the crow, cup, and snake, into the sky. The constellations of Corvus the crow and Hydra the water-snake are also identified with this myth.
