# FOSDEM Companion

Advanced native Android schedule browser application for the [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org/) conference in Brussels, Belgium.

This is a new implementation of the [legacy FOSDEM app](https://github.com/rkallensee/fosdem-android/). The code has been rewritten from scratch and the features have been extended. It uses loaders and fragments extensively and is backward compatible up to Android 2.1 thanks to the support library.

To get more information and install the app, look at the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.digitalia.fosdem) page.
