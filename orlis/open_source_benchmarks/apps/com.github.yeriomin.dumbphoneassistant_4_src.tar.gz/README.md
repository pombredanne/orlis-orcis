# Dumbphone Assistant
An android app which lets you copy contacts to your SIM card

Sometimes due to an emergency or simply because you are tired of
the constant pressure of a smartphone permanently connected to
the internet, you need to use an old phone. It is likely that 
the only way to move the contacts to it is the SIM card storage.
But built-in android contact manager lacks the ability to write
contacts to the SIM card. Thats when the Dumbphone Assistant
comes in.

Dumbphone Assistant lets you copy contacts from phone to SIM
card and vice-versa in bulk and individually.

This app is a rewrite of [simsalabim](https://code.google.com/p/simsalabim/).
It was last updated in 2010, when Android 2.0 came out.
Now it supports Android 1.5 through Android 6.0.
