## Description
Terminightor is a simple alarm clock for Android with a spicy special. In order to put off an alarm, you have to hold a NFC tag onto your phone. Unless you do that the alarm will not stop, even if you try to kill the Terminightor service.

So if you put a tag for example into your bathroom, and set up an alarm with that tag, it will ensure that you really get up in the morning.

## Features:
* repeat/don't repeat alarms
* repeat alarms only on certain week days
* custom ring-tone
* put vibration on/off
* put alarms off via NFC tag
