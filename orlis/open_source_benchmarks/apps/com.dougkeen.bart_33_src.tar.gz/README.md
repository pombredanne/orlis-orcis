# ![Logo](https://raw.github.com/dougkeen/BartRunnerAndroid/master/res/drawable-hdpi/icon.png) BART Runner
This is my "fun project", where I get a chance to work my Android development muscles and hopefully create something free and useful for the SF Bay Area community.

## Reporting bugs/requesting features
Please email all reports/requests to bartrunner@dougkeen.com

## Developed by
Doug Keen - doug@dougkeen.com

# Special thanks to

* Christophe Versieux's [HoloEverywhere](https://github.com/ChristopheVersieux/HoloEverywhere) project
* SimonVT's [android-numberpicker](https://github.com/SimonVT/android-numberpicker) project
* Jake Wharton's [NineOldAndroids](https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids), and [ActionBarSherlock](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock) projects

Without the hard work of the above individuals and all the contributors to their projects, BART Runner would look like crap on Android 2.x devices.
