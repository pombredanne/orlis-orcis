      - Lead V1
	- Monophasic R or QR or RS favors VT
	- Triphasic RSR' favors SVT
      - Lead V6
	- R to S ratio < 1 (R small than S) favors VT
	- RS or QR favors VT
	- Monophasic R favors VT
	- Triphasic favors SVT
	- R to S ration > 1 favors SVT
    - LBBB QRS
      - Lead V1 or V2
	- Any of the following R > 30 ms, >60 ms to nadir S, notched S favors VT

*** Brugada et al.
**** Notes
     - Text only refers to V1 and V6, figure (Fig 1) refers to V1-2 and
       V6
     - Table 1 on morphology criteria uses V1 for RBBB but V1 or V2 for LBBB
     - In text, step 4 = "if the tachycardia fulfilled the morphology criteria
       for VT in leads V1 and V6, the diagnosis of VT was made."
**** Criteria from Table 1

       - Lead V6
	 - R to S ratio < 1
	 - QS or QR
	 - Monophasic R
	 - Triphasic => SVT
	 - R to S > 1 => ?VT or SVT
*** Final criteria

*** Analysis
**** Wellens
***** At least 1 point in V1 and V6 => VT
***** Zero points => SVT
***** V1 and V6 discordant => indeterminate
***** Include rabbit ears? - not listed in Brugada
**** Brugada
***** At least 1 point in V1 and V6 => VT
***** Otherwise SVT
*** Implementation
    - Use figures and text for morphology criteria
    - Use checklist for Brugada morphology criteria
* Short QT Syndrome
** fine print of algorithm
   - Jpoint-Tpeak interval measured in precordial lead with greatest
     amplitude T wave.
   - Clinical History: events must occur in the absence of an
     identifiable etiology, including structural heart disease.
   - Points can only be received for 1 of cardiac arrest, documented
     polymorphic VT, or unexplained syncope.
   - Family history points can only be received once int his section.
   - A minimum of 1 point must be obtained in the ECG section in order
     to obtain additional points.  
* Rivaroxaban
  | CrCl           | Dose                          |
  | > 50 ml/min    | 20 mg daily with evening meal |
  | 15 - 50 ml/min | 15 mg daily with evening meal |
  | < 15 mL/min    | avoid                         |
* ICD Criteria
  1. Documented cardiac arrest due to VF, not due to transient or
     reversible cause.
  2. Documented sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia, either
     spontaneous or induced by EP study, not associated with an acute
     MI, and not due to a transient or reversible cause.
  3. Documented familial or inherited conditions with a high risk of
     life-threatening VT, such as long QT syndrome or hypertrophic
     cardiomyopathy.
  4. Documented prior MI, EF <= 35%, and inducible sus VT or VF at
     EPS.  (MI more than 40 days pre-ICD, and EPS performed > 4 weeks
     post MI.)
  5. Documented prior MI and EF <= 30%
  6. ICM, documented prior MI, Class II or III HF, EF <= 35%.
  7. NICM, > 9 months, Class II or III HF, EF <= 35%.
  8. Pts who meed CMS coverage criteria for CRT device and have Class
     IV HF.
  9. NICM > 3 months, Class II or III, and EF <= 35%.
** Exclusions
*** Cardiogenic shock or symptomatic hypotension
*** CABG or PCI within past 3 months
*** Acute MI within 40 days
*** Symptoms or findings that would make patient a candidate for revascularization
*** Irreversible brain damage from preexisting cerebral disease
*** Non-cardiac disease with likelihood of survival < 1 year
** Patients must be enrolled in ICD registry
** Note exclusions and registry apply to the primary prevention indications
** Parameters
   - Cardiac arrest y/n
   - sustained VT/VF spontaneous
   - sustained VT/VF induced
   - familial high risk condition
   - EF <= 35%
   - EF <= 30%
   - Documented MI
   - ICM
   - NICM
   - NYHA Class
   - Duration of CM
   - CRT indication
** Simplified Parameters
   - [ ] Cardiac arrest due to VF not due to reversible cause
   - [ ] Spontaneous or inducible VT/VF
   - [ ] Familial high risk condition (e.g. LQTS, HCM)
   - [ ] Documented MI
   - [ ] Ischemic CM
   - [ ] Nonischemic CM
   - [ ] Duration of CM
   - [ ] EF (radio group)
   - [ ] NYHA class (radio group)
   - [ ] CRT Indication?
*** Exclusions
    - [ ] Cardiogenic shock or symptomatic hypotension
    - CABG or PCI withing past 3 months
    - Acute MI within 40 days
    - Symptoms or findings that would make patient a candidate for revascularization
    - Irreversible brain damage from preexisting cerebral disease
    - Non-cardiac disease with likelihood of survival < 1 year
** Logic
   - Apply exclusions only where they should be (Primary prevention)
   - 3 month limit only for NICM
   - If indicated by too soon, say so
   - CRT indication only enters into Class IV CHF
     - Class IV excludes other indications
** Additional info
   - ACC/AHA/HRS indication
   - cite which CMS indication it falls under
   - button to list CMS indications
   - button to list AHA indications
   - change module to ICD indications?
   - maybe separate modules for CMS, AHA?
   - show study that supports each indication
     - AVID
     - MADIT II
     - etc.

	- LV criteria for epicardial
	  - Pseudo-delta wave (>= 34 ms)
	  - intrinsicoid deflection time >= 85 ms
	  - RS complex >= 121 ms

    Circulation 2004;109:1842-1847
    - Pseudo delta: earliest V activation to earliest fast deflection
      in any precordial lead.
    - Intrinsicoid Deflection Time: earliest V activation to peak of R
      wave in V2.
    - Shortest RS complex: earliest V activation to nadir of
      first S wave in any precordial lead.
    - QRS duration: earliest V activation to offset of QRS in
      precordial leads.
    - Proposed criteria
      - pseudodelta >= 34 ms Sens 83%, Spec 95%
      - intrinsicoid deflection time >= 85 ms Sens 87% Spec 90%

    - not metabolized, only renally excreted unchanged
    - AFB package insert dosing
      - do not start if QTc > 450 msec
      - 80 mg BID if CrCl > 60 ml/min, 80 mg once daily if 40-60.
        Contraindicated if CrCl < 40.  
      - can increase to 120 mg or 160 mg if QTc < 500 ms
      - 3 days recommended for hospitalization
* AT Location
** Kistler et al. Summary
   - in V1, - or + /- P 100% specific RA
   - in V1, -/+ or + P 100% sensitive LA
   - Algoritm sensitivity = 93%
   - P wave must have discrete iso segment before (i.e. not fused with
     T wave, etc.)
   - isoelectric means no P-wave deviation from the baseline of >=
     0.05 mV
   - Algorithm is for focal AT only

** Criteria
   - Concealed fusion y/n
   - S-QRS interval
     - Exit site S-QRS < 30% TCL
     - Central site S-QRS > 31-50% TCL
     - Proximal Site S-QRS 51-70%
     - Inner Loop S-QRS > 70%
   - TCL
   - PPI
   - PPI - TCL <= 30 msec in circuit
   - EGM-QRS interval
     - in circuit (with concealed fusion) S-QRS = EGM-QRS +/- 20 msec
** Long QT drugs

* DONE Verecki algorithm
** Algorithm (uses only lead avR)
   1. evaluate presence of initial R wave in avR
   2. initial r or q with width >= 40 msec
   3. notching on descending limb of a negative onset, predominantly
      negative QRS complex.
   4. Vi/Vt <= 1
      1. Vi = initial ventricular activation velocity
      2. Vt = terminal ventricular activation velocity
      3. Measured by excursion in mV recorded on the ECG during the
         initial Vi and terminal Vt 40 msec of the QRS
** Use of algorithm
   Similar to Brugada.  Yes at each step means VT.

ATRIA Stroke Risk Model Point Scoring System

Possible point scores range from 0 to 12 for those without a prior stroke and from 7 to 15 for those with a prior stroke. ATRIA indicates Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation; CHF, congestive heart failure; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; ESRD, end‐stage renal disease.
*** Results
| Score              | events/year |

| low 0-5 points     | < 1%        |
| moderate 6 points  | 1 to < 2%   |
| high 7 - 15 points | >= 2%       |

- Medical Hx = more than 2 of following: HTN, DM, CAD/MI, PAD, CHF, prior stroke, pulmonary disease, hepatic or renal disease.
- Treatment: interacting drugs, e.g. amiodarone
*** Results
- 0-2 Patients have high TTR (Time in Therapeutic Range)( e.g. >65%) so initiating VKA likely beneficial
- > 2 Improve education regarding AC control, or use a NOAC
