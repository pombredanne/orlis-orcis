Scrum Chatter
=============

Android app to track how long people talk during meetings.

* Add and delete team members
* Run meetings
* See how long each team member talked in one meeting
* See stats over all meetings: average chatter time per team member, total chatter time per team member
* Export a single meeting as text
* Export all meetings in Excel format

*Note*: This application does NOT use the microphone to automatically detect who is speaking. You must
manually press on a "play" button when a team member speaks.

Maintenance
===========
The things I would like to do in my free time require more time than the free time I currently have.
So, due to prioritizing my personal TODO list, I am currently not making any enhancements to this project.
Maybe some day (when I'm retired!) I'll be able to attack the issue list.
Pull requests are welcome, but the time to review and accept them may be slow.
Sorry, and thanks for understanding (if you understand :) ).
