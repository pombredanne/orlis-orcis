# Port Knocker

## Description
A basic port knocker client for Android. Similar to the other port knocker apps but with a nicer interface. Also includes a widget and the ability to choose an application to launch after knocking.

## Usage
First create a host. You must specify a label, hostname and at least one port. The delay (in ms) is the amount of time it will wait in between sending packets. The default value of 1000ms is recommended to prevent the host from receiving the packets out of sequence. You can optionally choose an app to launch after the knock is complete. Once the host has been created you can initiate the knock sequence by simply clicking on the host. The same thing applies to the widget.
