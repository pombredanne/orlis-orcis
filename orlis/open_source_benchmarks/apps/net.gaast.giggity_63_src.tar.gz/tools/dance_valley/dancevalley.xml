While the group took a brief hiatus, she released her first solo album, &#8220;The Dutchess&#8221;, she was also featured in Slash&#8217;s debut album &#8220;Slash&#8221; singing two rock songs &#8220;Beautiful Dangerous (feat. Fergie)&#8221; and &#8220;Paradise City (feat. Cypress Hill &amp; Fergie)&#8221;.

In the Summer of 2006. Her debut single titled &#9679;London Bridge quickly shot up to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She later released &#9679;Fergalicious, Glamorous, Big Girls Don&#8217;t Cry and &#9679;Clumsy, all of which led on to become top 5 singles on the chart.

As a child, she appeared on the television program Kids Incorporated for several years with Renee Sands, who would become another member of Wild Orchid. Ferguson&#8217;s well-scrubbed image on that show presents quite a contrast with the &#8220;ghetto-funk&#8221; image she has more recently begun to cultivate. Ferguson was the voice of Sally Brown in two Charlie Brown specials: It&#8217;s Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown (1984), Snoopy&#8217;s Getting Married, Charlie Brown (1985) and also voiced Sally in the 1985 version of &#8220;The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show&#8221;.

His single &#8220;Bromance&#8221; (recorded under the pseudonym Tim Berg, has charted in the top 20 on the national single charts of Belgium, the Netherlands, and his native Sweden. A lyricized version titled &#8220;Seek Bromance&#8221; was released shortly thereafter, charting on the UK Singles Chart and reaching number one on the international Beatport chart. Other singles include &#8220;My Feelings for You,&#8221; with Sebastien Drums, &#8220;Street Dancer,&#8221; and &#8220;Tweet It,&#8221; among others.

Avici is kind of like Dante&#8217;s Inferno &#8230; it&#8217;s the lowest level of hell in Buddhism. A friend of mine told me about it, and it stuck in my head. I was going to make up a name for my MySpace page for the first time, and I just kind of went for it. I tried a couple of other before, but they were all taken (laughing). I kind of ended up with Avicii, and then I got really attached to it.

He is part of a three person group dubbed the Swedish House Mafia, alongside Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso.

Angello was born to a Greek father and Swedish mother in Athens, Greece. His father was killed when Steve was a teenager. A life in Stockholm, Sweden and music took the better of him. He started out as a Turntablist, fusing hip-hop, breakbeats and 70&#8217;s classics but later moved onto house music, in the club life of Stockholm, together with his best friend Sebastian Ingrosso.

Steve Angello&#8217;s claim to fame came when he released his remix of Eurythmics &#8220;Sweet Dreams&#8221; in late 2004. Since then he has exploded onto the house music scene. In 2007 his eternal club banger, a remix of Robin S &#8220;Show Me Love&#8221; was released on Data records.

Angello produces under several different aliases. On his own, he has called himself Who&#8217;s Who and released tracks called &#8220;Not So Dirty&#8221; and &#8220;Sexy Fuck&#8221;. He often works closely with his childhood friend Sebastian Ingrosso on many projects. Aside from DJing together, they have also produced under the names Buy Now, Fireflies, General Moders, Mode Hookers, Outfunk, and The Sinners. Most recently, they released &#8220;Bodycrash&#8221; under their Buy Now alias, sampling the 1978 disco hit &#8220;Let&#8217;s All Chant&#8221; by the Michael Zager Band. The track was first played by Pete Tong on his Radio 1 show in late 2007. Eventually, the Dirty South remix of the tune leaked out onto the Internet in January 2008. The track has since received a much larger release via Positiva Records, also including the Laidback Luke remix.

Throughout his childhood, music was a huge part of his daily life. He was pressured by his parents at an early age to take up an instrument, and when he picked up his first guitar in 1998, he quickly showed a talent for it. During this time he developed a love for Daft Punk. In 2001 he moved in with his dad in London. There he got his first computer and was able to kindle his interest for electronic music. Through the internet Matan discovered the vast world of music production. He then got hold of some production software and started developing his own flavour. Matan explored the styles of trance, drum and bass, house, currently going with a more progressive sound. After 3 years, his productions are played by high profile DJs such as DJ Tarkan, Perry O&#8217;neil, and Swedish Egil.

By 2006, when he was only 16 years old, Matan had his first signing of a track, but it was after he won the Baroque Remix Competition with Lustral&#8217;s &#8220;In My Life&#8221; that many world-class DJs and producers began to notice this young producer&#8217;s great talents.

By mid-2007, Mat Zo had remixed the likes of Andy Moor and Markus Schulz. He became a DJ household name after Tiesto hired him to remix &#8220;Driving To Heaven&#8221;, and the remix appeared on Ti&#235;sto&#8217;s internationally recognized &#8220;In Search Of Sunrise 7&#8221; CD compilation.

Although the humble, softly spoken duo would never shout it out themselves, Super8 &amp; Tab are undoubtedly among them.

Renowned for their innovative approach and intricate production values, the Finnish producers have stealthily pushed themselves to the front of the trance pack since coming together in 2005.
DJs like Armin van Buuren, PVD, Above &amp; Beyond &amp; Ferry Corsten regularly smash their tracks both club-side and on the radio, while global dance bibles such as Mixmag and DJmagazine laud them with 5 star reviews.

Through their own energising DJ sets, Super8 &amp; Tab themselves have conquered some of the biggest club brands in the game. They headlined the Future stage at this year&#8217;s Trance Energy, recently played Australia&#8217;s Future Music Festival and have also rocked trance totem poles like The Gallery, Mayday, Godskitchen, Trance Energy and A State Of Trance. On home turf, they command a legendary residency at Helsinki&#8217;s legendary Hallmark club and also find time to hold down a regular spot on the monthly Anjunabeats Worldwide radio show.
Now an integral part of the Anjunabeats family, Super8 &amp; Tab first caused a fervour with the breakthrough success of tracks like &#8216;First Aid&#8217; and the definitive &#8216;Helsiniki Scorchin&#8217;. Since establishing themselves as the label&#8217;s best selling artist behind Above &amp; Beyond, the Finnish trailblazers have delivered trance of the highest quality ever since - their ethereal epic &#8216;Suru&#8217; was picked out by DJmagazine as &#8220;the tent-pole release of Anjuna&#8217;s summer&#8221;, while &#8216;Elektra&#8217; conquered the download charts and festival stages with equal aplomb in 2008.

Classically trained as a pianist and a perfectionist when it comes to programming, his unique blends of deep melodies and sunny electronic grooves are equally at home in the DJ sets of Sasha or Desyn Masiello as they are in the stadium headlining appearances of Above &amp; Beyond.

&#8232;Despite his relative youth, Jaytech&#8217;s prodigious creativity and prolific work rate (he started producing at just 14 and released his first track at 16) have seen him rise up as the most consistent artist on the popular Anjunadeep imprint &#8212; even releasing the label&#8217;s first full artist album through 2008&#8217;s &#8216;Everything Is Ok&#8217; (&#8220;Lush, melodic and soaked in electronic groove - a crossover gem&#8221; **** -DJ Magazine), and hitting number one in the iTunes dance chart with his Anjunadeep 02 mix compilation in 2010. (&#8220;Compilation of the month **** -Mixmag.)

Cementing his position as one of the leading lights within deep, uplifting electronic music, Jaytech&#8217;s monthly mix show &#8216;Jaytech Music&#8217; now airs on radio stations across the globe and is downloaded by thousands as a monthly podcast. A window into his sound, it&#8217;s also the best place to hear Jaytech&#8217;s upcoming personal productions before anyone else.

01
Radio Slave aka Matt Edwards

No matter what sounds you profess to be your music of choice, chances are, that at some point over the last five years, you will have got your rocks off to Matt Edwards.

As Matthew E he fashions club-based, dancefloor slayers. Under that aegis hes updated the classic Chi-town, sound beloved of house aficionados and layered it with fractured funk, belligerent, oddball beats and mechanical soul.

If Matthew E is all about the Saturday Night Fever, then, by contrast, Rekid is the slower, more deliberate, rhythmical funk of the mid-week mayhem. Its well-intentioned muscular intensity making it perfect soulful sustenance.

Quiet Village is something else all together. A collaboration with long-time musical sparring partner Joel Martin (a vinyl freak, like Mr Edwards, who works in esteemed auction house Christies pop department), its sample-based music which veers from drawn out disco-not-disco delirium to evocative, under-stated soundscapes.

Sea Devils - you keeping up at the back &#8211; is undeniable electronic pop brilliance. Working with Tom from Cagedbaby, its the least niche of Matts projects and thanks to Sea Devils alluring pop dance grooves they will no doubt be shagging the upper reaches of the hit parade sometime soon.

Last, but by no means least etc, etc, etc, is Radio Slave.

This Rotterdam born and raised talent with Portuguese blood understands the art of using the funk, of getting the dancing floor full and the room to its feet. Although confessed because of its groovy/funky (deep) tech-house sound with lots of detroit, minimal and acid influences , he also knows that he has to do some work now and then and he knows how he must use that hatchet, what results in a particularly strong and delightful portion of techno which remains above everything well digestible.

Meanwhile he has turn tabled at all the major and important clubs and festivals in the Netherlands.
On the international base he has showcased his skills around the rest of the world (Opium Garden Miami, Hao Man 17 Jerusalem, Resident-dj for Chris Liebing&#8217;s Spinclub night @ Space Ibiza &amp; Privelege, Ibiza, Antwerp where he held a 3 year saturday night-residency at the famous Belgium superclub: Cafe d&#8217; Anvers + the annual Detroit&#8217;s Electronic Music Festival (Movement/Fuse-in) where he is a gladly seen guest being invited twice (2005/2006) by the legends of techno: Derrick May &amp; Kevin Saunderson).

Besides his huge (mainly dutch) amount of dj-gigs, Benny&#8217;s main focus nowadays is to produce music wich reflects his tipycal edge sound, so the rest of the world will get to know and experience where Benny Rodrigues musically stands for. With releases scheduled on Darren Emerson&#8217;s (ex-Underworld) Underwater Records and other very interesting upcoming projects he&#8217;s setting himself quite a good step in the right direction!

Chicago, like Puerto Rico, is a city rich with musical styles and sounds.

It was in Chicago that Sneak found inspiration in underground house music, Warehouse parties and &#8220;old school&#8221; mix tapes from the early pioneers - Farley Jackmaster Funk, Ralphi Rosario, Steve Hurley and local radio station shows played on WBMX. Sneak earned his nickname rocking designs in the graffiti tagging days and began working at retail stores as an airbrush artist, not long after he cultured the music industry world and began recording his first releases.

While at retail stores Sneak developed his DJing skills around the city working regular mobile DJ jobs and local nightclubs. In an already saturated DJ pool, Sneak focused on music production and started an independent label - Defiant Records. In 1992, using the fundamental studio pieces, Sneak began recording tracks with an unusual new style. In 1994, while still working at local store Gramophone Records sneak met Cajmere (Green Velvet) owner of Cajual and Relief Records.

Cajmere released some of Sneak&#8217;s pivotal tracks and helped bring international recognition, with it, a global DJing career.In 1995, Sneak&#8217;s new sound revolutionized house music with inspirational sounds and rhythms never heard. The disco filtered house grooves became Sneak&#8217;s signature sound. Innovator to many, Sneak&#8217;s love for music spawned current talents such as Daft Punk, Basement Jaxx &amp; Armand Van Helden.

When he was eighteen, to broaden the knowledge he acquired in Naples, underground he moved to London - the capital city of electronic-music.

In London, he started to produce his first work with just a few machines, which were studies on instruments functionalities and their ranges of use, and his first work was published by Primate and soon Audio and contrast published some EPs.

In 1999 Davide went back to Naples and he started to play gigs now and then. He took time out of playing and producing for two years to study sound engineering. This polishing of his technical knowledge allowed him to fully express his ideas and create work of outstanding quality.

Both DESIGN MUSIC and CONFORM, released his work initially, earning positive critical appraisal internationally. In time, Davide began to struggle with the limitations imposed on his music by these labels and decided to set up on his own. He therefore set up the Sketch project, to finally be free to create sounds true to his pure tastes.

Three years later he set up his second label, MINISKETCH, geared towards more minimalist productions. Davide Squillace is also known as erikOtanabE, an alter ego born as an outlet for another tangent of his genius where he assembles different kind of beats, with greater liberty taken using sounds &amp; samples. His tracks are a mix of minimal tek and glitch house, resulting in something the discerning techno listener can enjoy at a club as well as pottering about the house cooking some beans on toast.

Biography

Reputation is a wonderful thing. It&#8217;s certainly something Liverpool DJ/Producer Yousef has come accustomed too, carving his own legacy across the global electronica circuit for close on a decade. Yousef was first bitten by the acid house bug at the legendary rave metropolis &#8220;Shelly&#8217;s&#8221; in 1991 and since then has grabbed the global industry by the scruff of the neck, forcing his way in through sheer talent and determination. Residencies at Ministry of Sound, Renaissance and most notably Cream, cemented the scouse empire with a love of house at a point where trance began to rule clubland. Yousef then went on to conquer the rest of the UK taking his infallible understanding of house to Basics, Pressure, Shindig and every other top UK club. The rest of the world followed with Yousef skipping across continents with the same glee as the snapping beats in the music he played. Booked in the world&#8217;s best clubs on a regular basis, Yousef quickly became synonymous as one of dance music&#8217;s global figures, a position he
still holds to great acclaim.

It is clear that Yousef loves to travel (lucky then with the amount he does) &#8220;I love seeing the world and its dancefloors&#8221;, Yousef adds. &#8220;I love going to Montreal, it&#8217;s multicultural and multi-sexual and musically broad. My favourite places include New York, LA, South America and Brazil; it&#8217;s so good down there - Rio, Sao Polo, Porto Alegre, amazing, high energy parties. In Argentina - The Mau Club so underground and intense. And then there&#8217;s Asia, Japan, just a wonderful country where the vibes never fails to amaze me, Sydney, Melbourne, all over Europe, I could go on!&#8221;

Composed of Matthew &#8216;Bushwacka&#8217; B, a percussionist in the London School Symphony Orchestra who was converted into a member of the infamous Rat Pack after a warehouse party in &#8217;88, and Layo Paskin, a North Londoner immersed in the acid house scene who met Mr C at one of the legendary Clink Street parties in 1988, before together setting up their world renowned night club, The End. It was via their mutual friend Mr C that Layo &amp; Bushwacka! first met, whilst Matthew was working at his studio, and by the mid 90s the two had started writing music together. Over a decade later, the partnership has yielded three artist albums, three mix albums, internationally renowned club residencies and a superb record label.

By 1999 they&#8217;d already composed their debut album, &#8216;Low Life&#8217;, released on End Recordings, the label spawned by The End. The album announced the arrival of the duo as a force in electronic music, with a record that brought together electro, house and breakbeat fused with blues, dub and downtempo, all underpinned and informed by their collective experience of underground culture. This inclusive and open minded approach to sound became the blueprint for their future work.

Their sophomore album followed in 2002, this time released on the mighty XL Recordings. Entitled &#8216;Night Works&#8217;, the record featured their unforgettable top ten hit &#8216;Love Story&#8217;, and took their sound onto a bigger and broader canvas, selling 100,000 copies in the process.

He and his friends helped develop the dance music scene in Slovenia, and between them they were responsible for putting on the first large scale parties in Slovenia. The result has been that Umek is Slovenia&#8217;s most famous techno DJ, and a prolific producer. His current style is the combination of many different roots, which the more long term Umek fans may recognise. Starting with a rough, uncompromising edge he quickly built a reputation in the studio. However, more recently he has moved towards a funkier sound&#8230;

Most of his tracks are named after medicines or other substances.

1) Dutch Progressive Psychedelic-Trance producer; and 2) Australian Hip-Hop producer.

1) Born in 1976, multi talented Dutch artist C-Jay took up an early interest in electronic and experimental music from the hands of artists like Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis and Tangerine Dream. At the age of 11, C-Jay started taking his first muscial educations on the ins- and outs of both digital and analogue instruments, with the enthousiastic love and support of his parents.

As an artist / producer C-Jay got his first worldwide release in the spring of 2004.This tune (SwayWatch) got signed to the Moun10 imprint, (owned by Dutch house legend Jaydee) and got massive support from artists like The Flash Brothers, Chris Fortier and Fred Numf. After this first one the attention of the scene rapidly grew. His second release was made together with his friend Jaydee under their &#8220;Graylock&#8221; moniker and got released on First Impression Recordings, the label of &#8230;&#8230;Jaydee. This release got supported, played and charted by Armin Van Buuren, Ton TB, Paul Van Dyk, The Flash Brothers, Carl Cox, Chris Fortier and many more. The release also made it into the higher ranks of the world renowned Balance Record Pool charts.

Due to the fact that both releases were received so well by the international dance scene, C-Jay decided to start his own record label &#8220;The Sessions Recordings.&#8221; The basic idea behind it was to have no boundaries in releasing his own material, not having to depend on other labels in this early stage of his career and trying to draw the attention of the big guys even more.

Fans and enthusiasts worldwide have come to love the sympathetic Dutchman for his affectionate sound, unique productions and energetic DJ sets, which have taken him from sun-soaked Mexico to Russia, and almost everywhere in between. And it&#8217;s not just the fans that are moved by his work; avid followers include internationally renowned DJs such as Hern&#225;n Catt&#225;neo, Sasha and Dave Seaman, who occasionally drop his tracks in clubs and festivals around the world.

He&#8217;s been involved with music since very young, playing in several bands that offered a tribute to very different styles like black metal or pop. He showed a passion for synthesizers since he was a child, but it is in 1999 when electronic music captures him in an irreversible way, and he starts his fulltime dedication to music production. Since then, he has been working with several artists and bands linked to the vanguard, delivering many projects. While studying Sound Engineering he contacts Logicalnoise Records, where he finds a philosophy similar to his own and a flexible label that cares for quality proposals. Nowadays, he combines his work for advertising and documentary with electronic music and live performances.
Always open-minded to up and coming new styles and very fond of artistic vanguard, he delivers productions and sets that stand out for it&#8217;s eclecticism and intensity, always trying to stimulate the audience.
Even before the launch of his first solo vinyl, the prestigious British label Global Underground spots Henry Saiz and asks him to remix the work from the German producer Phonique for a new vinyl that is about to be released.
His fist vinyl, &#8220;Mamut Ep&#8221;, released by Logicalnoise, is a really elegant and sophisticated piece that illustrates very well Henry&#8217;s electronic music concept: hypnotic and powerful vibes to travel in the dance floor.

Mentored by Sasha, James&#8217;s sets and releases are strongly influenced by tech house, electro house and breakbeat stylings and his unique capitalization of all available mixing aid &#8220;utilities&#8221; give his performances characteristic depth and professional production quality.

He is known for his turntable skills, extensive use of loops and effects, and the use of the Pioneer CDJ1000s, EFX1000 as well as more recently using Ableton Live.

James gained fame in 2000 by winning Muzik Magazine&#8217;s Bedroom Bedlam competition, Best Bedroom Bedlam DJ 2001, and has since been signed to Sasha&#8217;s Excession agency.

The music emanating from the DJ booth is that perfect club mix of driving percussion and soaring musicality, bursting out of the speakers, soaking everyone in melody, drenching them in sound. On the floor, where it really matters, the crowd experiences all the peaks and troughs that make Warren&#8217;s sensibility so unique. He might start with his deeper take on house, then gradually morph into harder territory; then, once Warren has the throng fully in his grip, sweating and losing themselves in the grooves, moving on instinct, he takes them to points unknown they never expected to go. That&#8217;s why Nick Warren is so respected: he knows how to truly work a crowd, delivering again and again, yet taking them somewhere they&#8217;ve never been before. That&#8217;s what comes with vision and, just as importantly in Warren&#8217;s case, experience.

To this day, Warren remains at the forefront of club culture: he packs clubs and arenas worldwide from London to Los Angeles to Taipei, transfixing dancefloors with his distinctively forward blend of credible progressive sounds, cutting-edge techno, atmospheric breaks and any other crucial grooves Warren deems appropriate for his turntable alchemy. 2008 also finds Warren reaching other milestones. He&#8217;s releasing his eighth mix CD for the Global Underground series, GU035: Lima; he&#8217;s also completing his fourth studio album with Way Out West, Warren&#8217;s pioneering electronic/band collaboration with Jody Wisternoff. Warren also recently became head of A&amp;R for Hope Recordings, keeping him immersed in the shifting tides of new dance-music movements. &#8220;I&#8217;m doing same thing I did when I started&#8212;just playing music I love,&#8221; he says.

From his early years of DJing at Bedrock nights in his home town of Hastings, to the 10+ hour sets in New York today, one thing remains the same - a complete love of all music. It&#8217;s this passion and plenty of hard work that has helped Danny to get where he is today. It&#8217;s no coincidence that he&#8217;s been placed in DJ Magazine&#8217;s top 20 DJs in the world for the last 3 years. Danny has a unique, eclectic sound which as been described as &#8220;deepsexyfuturistictechfunkhouse&#8221; and it&#8217;s this sound which which is shaking floors worldwide.

With over 12 years of experience, Danny has become truly international. His hectic schedule regularly takes him all over Europe, North and South America, Asia and Australia. He&#8217;s DJed in the world&#8217;s coolest clubs and held residencies at Renaissance, Twilo and Home. With 2002 came the announcement of an exciting monthly residency at Vinyl in New York, where Danny&#8217;s 10 hour marathon sets are fast becoming legendary.

It&#8217;s not just in the club where Danny has made a name for himself, he&#8217;s also been busy in the studio. Albums for Global Underground, Renaissance and his own Nocturnal Frequencies series have been the highlights in a continually growing back catalogue of acclaimed mixes. As a producer his main focus is with co-producer Dick Trevor and vocalist Erire as &#8220;Science Dept.&#8221;. Last year they released the highly successful single &#8220;Breathe&#8221; and fans can expect more to follow in 2002.

Danny&#8217;s infectious personality and individual style is what really puts him a cut above the rest though. You can really sense his connection with the crowd wherever he plays, and he has fully earned the label &#8220;the clubbers DJ&#8221;.

This music played a role in the music he now plays. Hernan describes the music he plays as deep, progressive, funky and tribal house.

In 1996, he won the residency at Clubland Pacha in Buenos Aires. His performances were a great success and led to Cattaneo being invited to DJ at clubs around Latin America. Clubland eventually attracted big-name DJs, such as Sasha, John Digweed, Dave Seaman and Paul Oakenfold who played alongside Hernan. Oakenfold was impressed and signed Hernan Cattaneo to his Perfecto Records label and they toured together in Europe and the United States from 1997 to 1999.

By 2000, Cattaneo was a major name on the world club circuit. Underground releases entitled Clubland Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 created an underground buzz. Also, a DJ magazine released one of his mixes called Funky, Deep &amp; Tribal in 2001. In 2002 he produced the international hit &#8220;Deep Funk&#8221;, released his first mix compilation entitled &#8220;Perfecto Presents South America&#8221; on Paul Oakenfold&#8217;s label, and won the &#8220;Best Newcomer DJ&#8221; at the Pacha Ibiza Awards. Since releasing his first compilation, he has played about 200 shows a year on every continent around the world.

As a DJ with an ever increasing fanbase, he rose to #22 and then to #6 on the DJ Mag poll of the Top 100 DJs. In addition to appearing repeatedly on John Digweed&#8217;s Kiss 100 Show due to great reviews of his mixes, Hernan also has a weekly residency show in London that is broadcast on MetroDance 95.

The Motown sound from mom &amp; dad&#8217;s music collection appeared to be determining for Phonic Funk&#8217;s musical preferences. While collecting music his preferences got more specific and around his 14th Phonic Funk started his own small drive-inn show. Friends, family and strangers could now meet the driven artist.

After the period of &#8216;DAP&#8217; turntables and Discmans the time was born to handle things more serious. Two Pioneer CD-players were bought so that it became possible to test own material. After the generally known &#8216;Bedroom period&#8217; the most satisfying mixes were spread to get clubs and organizers interested.

The Phonic Funk debut followed quickly at an illegal party organized by a friends organization. Step by step the Phonic Funk career and style evolved. Automatically the decision followed to give full dedication to house music.

In the meanwhile Phonic Funk had the honor to perform with the likes of John Acquaviva, Roog, Laidback Luke and Fedde Le Grand. This at recognized venues such as &#8216;De Winkel van Sinkel and &#8216;De Lichtfabriek&#8217;.

To develop himself Phonic Funk has also devoted himself to the producing side of Music. Relatively quick this resulted in winning The Netherlands&#8217; largest producer contest &#8216;Vinylized&#8217;.

At the beginning of the 90&#8217;s he fell in love with house music, the music that he heard while clubbing in Amsterdam&#8217;s legendary clubs RoXY and iT. Roog has graduated from law school with a specialisation in Intellectual Property. Roog has been voted number 1 house dj of Holland last 3 years by Dutch Magazine; Bassic Groove, was voted most popular club dj of Holland 2004 by Nieuwe Revu Magazine and was the highest ranked house dj in the Dutch Dj Award poll of 2003 and 2004.

This event brought him, from well known in the underground house scene, to the Dutch DJ super league. Roog has compiled 7 cd&#8217;s till date. The
sound of Love and Dedication (United/Zomba, 2000) was the first compilation under his own name and was critically acclaimed by Dutch audiences as well as Dutch music press.

1) London, UK based DJ/production duo Sam Holt &amp; Gavin Mills endeavour to make soulful house with a global vibe. They are soon to release of their debut album - Voices and Visions. A collection of soulful house, classic song-writing, with latin / afrobeat / disco / funk / tech influences, with guest singers.

&#8216;Voices and Vision&#8217;s&#8217; is set propel Copyright into the super league of global house players. Having their first proper release on the hugely influential US label Soulfuric back in 2000, the boys proceeded to put out a slew of quality tracks on that and several other labels (including their own imprint, Copyright Recordings) in the early noughties. Tracks like &#8216;Good For You&#8217; feat Angie Brown, &#8216;Bulo&#8217; with longtime friend and percussion collaborator Shovel and &#8216;Release Yourself&#8217; set the pace, while their move to Defected in 2005 saw them jump up a gear with tracks like &#8216;He Is&#8217;, &#8216;Bring Me Love&#8217; and &#8216;I Pray&#8217;. The international recognition they received from these releases culminated in Defected boss Simon Dunmore asking Copyright to mix the 2007 &#8216;Miami In The House&#8217; compilation. Distilling the Copyright sound while showcasing their mixing prowess and nose for what makes a great party, it went on to sell more than 30, 000 copies globally. Which begs the question, with so much success, how come it&#8217;s taken them so
long to finally deliver their debut long player? &#8220;I think we wanted to wait until the time was completely right,&#8221; says Gavin.

Extract from the official webpage http://chocolatepuma.com:

&#8220;Many beautiful years have passed between their first monster hit Give It Up and now. Born as first generation house producers, a complete musical revolution has taken place right in front of Zki &amp; Dobres eyes: From the first simple sampler, to a complete digital studio built into a laptop.

DJ Zki &amp; Dobre; who are they and what are they up to? Two simple but pressing questions which are not easy to answer. The Dutch producers Zki &amp; Dobre- respectively Ren&#233; ter Horst and Gaston Steenkist are responsible for so many productions in all kinds of styles under so many different names that they are extremely difficult to categorize.

Their studio remains their favorite place, but as DJ&#8217;s, the clubs is where their music is being tested and where their music should be played out loud! Great examples are I Wanna Be U (2001), A Star Is Born (2003) and Always And Forever (2006) which they released under their alter ego Chocolate Puma.

Lets go back in time a little. For sure a special mission from outer space has helped faith a little to ensure that these two all-round musical guys bumped into each other in the 90s.

Together they produced their first hit; The Good Men &#8220; Give It Up&#8221;.

Ren&#233;: We are still very proud of Give It Up. It was created on a small mixer and mixed on broken speakers in Gastons bedroom. Its a unique record that people still sample and play. The whole world knows that record!

Even if they have different background and professional training, they&#8217;re united by their common desire to release new productions and give their own contribution to the international dance and club scene. They put together their previous experiences to launch their new label: the Cube that in 2006 has been renamed C90 Records.

Roberto Intrallazzi started his musical career at the end of the 80&#8217;s as one of the producer of the F.P.I. Project , one of the most successful project of the &#8216;made in Italy&#8217; dance era, between the 80&#8217;s and the 90&#8217;s. Their track &#8216;Rich in Paradise&#8217; climbed all the worldwide charts and was considered one of the first house music releases. In the 90&#8217;s his sound evolved over the years and became more &#8216;house&#8217;, but always influenced by the 80&#8217;s electro experience. We can say that his music comes from the combination between the 80&#8217;s typical strong energy and the research for new rhythms, with the contemporary minimal-electronic sound.

In 2000 Roberto Intrallazzi met Luca Provera, dj and producer.

Luca is a guy really keen on music and technology since he was very young, he started early to develop his own recording studio and to become familiar with computers, mixer, sampler and keyboards.

Nicky hits the first snare drum at the age of 6 and started playing drums in a fanfare. After playing a year or three, he&#8217;d been asked to play in a huge group who had acts on street and big events. That was fun though, but not enough for small Nicky. At the age of 12 he got is first set of Drums, and started practising, practising and practising. Well, after 3 years playing drums everyday and night , it was enough and he changed the drums for turntables.

School never had his interest, so after graduating he started producing music. And after hours, hours and hours of practising (throw lots of computers out of the window) he got his first label called &#8220;Once Records&#8221;, who&#8217;s going to release the tracks: Privilege &amp; QWERTY.

After that deal, the next track came up called &#8220;Funktion One&#8221;. From that moment everything went very fast. Dutch famous DJ/Producer Madskillz got interested in &#8220;Funktion One&#8221; from that on Nicky signed Funktion at Azucar (from Madskillz &amp; Gregor Salto). Later they added &#8220;Hear My Sound&#8221; to their label two!

These day&#8217;s allmost every high rated DJ has a few Romero records in his bag, last summer he did a remix for &#8220;Sidney Samson &amp; Tony Cha Cha - Get On The Floor&#8221; and a bootleg for &#8220;David Guetta - When Love Takes Over&#8221;. Both tracks got alot of publicity in the world, even Ministry of Sound Australia contacted him for doing some remixes on their label! About a few hundred movie&#8217;s came up at youtube from dj&#8217;s who playing the

Crank up the computer and Google &#8230;the Martinez Brothers,&#8230; and you&#8230;ll be directed to chatrooms containing comments like &#8230;Oh my god, can these two kids rock the house&#8230; and &#8230;They can mix their asses off&#8230;not to mention postings along the lines of &#8230;They are the cutest ever&#8230; Such accolades would be impressive for any DJ, considering the backbiting that is the norm in the online dance-music community, but when you realize that the subjects of those notices, Steve and Chris Martinez, are still in their teens, it. .s remarkable. And considering that the Bronx-born and -raised sibs are working in the world of traditional, NYC-style soulful house&#8230;a scene generally populated by relative graybeards&#8230;it&#8230;s downright mind-boggling.

Within the last year, the duo has been rising through the ranks by rocking some of the city&#8230;s top soulful house shindigs, including Shelter (a soiree that was born the same year as the 15-year-old Chris) and Danny Krivit&#8230;s 718 Sessions. They have further been invited to play at the longest standing soulful house party in Paris, Cheers in December and their names will be added to a list of DJ legends such as Timmy Regisford, Quentin Harris and Carl Craig when they headline Dublin&#8230;s Surface event the same month. &#8230;It was our father who really got us into this,&#8230; says Steve, who&#8230;s all of 18 years old. &#8230;He&#8230;s an old house head who goes back to the days of places like the Garage, but he had stepped away from the scene for a long time. Around three years ago, he played us a lot of the music and we both just fell in love with it&#8230;

Being connected to techno music for a while, where he released his first twelve-inch and developed his dj and producer skills, came in the late 90&#180;s with the desire of embracing other styles. House music became his main inspiration.

His vision and his style, both clearly reflect his origins, very percussive and tribal, and recently, with his musical productions, has been truly noticed and acclaimed by some of the biggest house names in the scene such as Tony Thomas, Tom Stephan, Grant Dell, Terry Francis, Nathan Coles, Layo, Circulation, Justin Drake from Peace Division, and also by the Uk&#180;s main dance press like Mixmag, Jockey Slut and Dj Magazine.
In the beginning of this century he builds a production studio in London, and materializes two important projects: 4Kenzo Recordings and Digital Distribution with dj Token Pace.
The dj work increases in this period and he plays in important clubs such as Rex (Paris), Ultimate Base (London), Gas (London), The Cross (London), Locomia (Albufeira), Kremlin (Lisbon), Alcantara Club (Lisbon), Decadance (Belgium) among others.

At just 21 it&#8217;s fair to say he&#8217;s &#8216;been around&#8217; if you take into consideration his achievements over the past 18 months. His passion for music, in particular his love of all things house, has helped this multi-talented producer climb his way to the top. Hardwell&#8217;s overall talent is recognised by the dance music industry as a new, exciting and refreshing take on a scene that continues to evolve and with an apparent everlasting shelf life!

&#8220;Guess What&#8221;, a recent co-production with Chuckie, is likely to be one of the most played underground house records of the past two years, his &#8220;Show Me Love vs. Be&#8221; bootleg of Steve Angello and Sebastien Ingrosso&#8217;s track was one of the biggest dance hits of last year and &#8220;MRKRSTFT&#8221; has been included in almost all of the house compilations of 2008.

On top of this pronounced success stories, Hardwell has also topped the leading Dutch chart &#8216;Dance-Tunes.com&#8217; a grand total of 6 times in the past 12 months. He has also taken up remix duties for artists such as Chris Lake, Funkerman, Laidback Luke, Sharam (Deep Dish), Steve Angello, Booty Luv and Hi_Tack amongst others&#8230;need we go on?

Behind the decks Hardwell never fails to deliver, his exceptional technical skills, variety of music and that added personal touch make him stand out, and he&#8217;s ready to bring this to the masses.

There&#8217;s a new kid on the block, and he&#8217;s here to stay.

Clubs, parties and housemusic

At the age of 17 he discovered the world of clubs, parties and housemusic, which had just started to reach Holland, coming across the ocean from the great clubs in New York, Chicago and Detroit. Soon he was addicted to the Vibe called housemusic and started to go to houseparties more often. Then something happened to him that happens to all true DJ&#8217;s at a certain moment: he got fascinated by the guy standing in front of the partypeople and playing his favourite tunes; Tha Vibe struck on him. Ladies and gentlemen:

Fascinated by the first acid and house tracks in the late 1980s, Scot Project began to incorporate these new sounds in his sets, showcasing music from the house, hip hop and techno scene.

By 1990 he had landed several residencies around Frankfurt and two years later began building his own studio, closely followed by his first single; &#8216;X&#8217; released on Overdose in 1995. By the time his hugely successful second single &#8216;U (I Got A Feeling)&#8217; hit clubland in 1996, Scot Project was playing regularly in the USA, Canada, Brazil, Russia and Israel. A massive European club hit, it was &#8216;U&#8217; that launched DJ Scot Project to international fame

Scot Project has also completed a string of highly-regarded remix projects for German labels including Pulse, Fog, Area and Intercord among others. Most recently, he enjoyed massive success in the UK during 2001, applying the midas touch to the big room track of the moment; &#8216;Firewire&#8217;.

Bringing deeper, dirtier trance to his sets, DJ Scot Project combines hard percussive elements with melodic trance. In his own words: &#8216;The perfect combination of sugar and spice.&#8217;

Their goal is to create the kind of music that ranges from majestic highs to crushing lows in the span of one song, leaving the listener breathless and reeling in its wake. Thera began writing such music after solidifying their lineup in January of 2009, and releasing the remarkably mature ep, The Aftermath, in April of 2009. However, the true beginnings of the band go back much earlier: Thera was first conceived in 2005 by founding members Ronnie Plate and Stephanie Plate in the small-town of Soldotna, Alaska, where they cut their teeth playing their first local shows. They quickly progressed to playing around the rest of the state, which brought them into contact with their future drummer, Benny Maus. They found their lead guitarist, Mason Venhaus, after moving to Oklahoma in the summer of 2007 in order to pursue both music and higher education.

After returning to Alaska in the start of 2009, Thera added their fifth and final member in bassist Steven Cornfield. They quickly regained and increased their local fanbase with the release of The Aftermath and consistent gigging.

Work on their full-length indie debut, If This Is the End&#8230;, began in the fall of 2009. Set to release in February of 2010, If This Is the End&#8230;

At a young age he was surrounded by music; learning to play the piano and singing in the school choir and other youth choirs. His singing was quite successful, performing at the openings of some of Sydney&#8217;s most prestigious events as well as singing on albums.

Dance music had always been a part of his life as his older siblings passed down the music that they so passionately listened to, the music that was heard throughout the clubs at the time. This was also the music that was played at the &#8220;all age&#8221; events that he attended. When he turned 18 he began to develop his skills as a DJ and became attracted to the pulsing beat of the harder styles of Dance music. Overwhelmed with his passion for dance music JP decided to follow his dream of becoming a DJ and Producer. He built his own recording studio and is now on the path to his dream.

After a number of years of travelling and learning his craft JP is now set to release on Dutch Master Works, one of the World&#8217;s Number 1 Hardstyle Labels, home to Showtek, Dutch Master and many more great talents.

In 2008 it seemed JP&#8217;s dream of becoming a world renowned DJ/Producer and vocalist was finally coming true. He was invited to play at X- Qlusive Showtek at the Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam and also the prestigious Defqon 1 Festival in Almere Holland, both of which are great honours to bestow on any DJ.

&#8220;The Abyss &amp; Judge sound is very diverse,&#8221; says DJ/producer Gevrey Heijnes, &#8220;but catchy as well. We prefer hardstyle with great melodies, heavy basses and pounding kicks.&#8221; He should know, since he forms the Abyss &amp; Judge duo together with fellow DJ/Producer Justin Putuhena.

Abyss:
Gevrey decided to get involved with the magic of vinyl at the age of 15. Records and mixing tracks were really something to focus on and so oldstyle, hardcore and houseclassics (Late 80&#8217;s and early 90&#8217;s) were the start in his repertoire. More people started to notice Gevrey&#8217;s unique skills and passion to always look for exciting new musical paths. So it was no surprise when the hardstyle sound started to conquer the scene, Gevrey was on the forefront.

They are signed to Fusion Records, home to famous hardstyle artists like Zany, Noisecontrollers and Donkey Rollers.

Elie produced UK Hardcore, House, trance and electro while Olcay was also producing UK Hardcore and Gabber. They occasionally produced together as Lumin8 &amp; Cheever. Then after the opportunity arose in Australia with the arrival of Q-Dance this opened up many oppurtunities for the Australian Born and bred Duo. They decided to begin producing hardstyle together, bringing Australian hardstyle to a totally new level, and have now placed the country down under, on the map.
Even though they are still fairly new in the hardstyle scene, in 2009 they had a massive response to their music, gathering support from massive artists from the top&#8230; Within their first year, coming from Australia, they have already played at Defqon.1 Australia, and have begun their Europe Tour.

Toneshifterz now are, and have been signed to the renowned Fusion Records and have had some massive releases that started with &#8220;Sahara&#8221;. After that they we&#8217;re honored enough to work with the talented and most awarded hardstyle artists in the scene at the moment, the &#8216;Noisecontrollers&#8217; on their second release collaborating the tracks &#8220;Jaydee&#8221; and &#8220;Empire of the Sun&#8221; which both were massive hits.

Exploring their musical strengths seperately, both guys knew that this meeting was the beginning of something they dreamed from the beginning they started getting their musical love to a higher level.

Diederik always had a big love for melody. Music was not only his passion, but also his strength. With his father producing electronic music in his own studio in Amsterdam, Diederik heard the word music before he even knew what it was. This fact resulted in a big musical interest in the years that passed.

Stefan started to create his musical point of view in the early nineties, when happy hardcore was introduced. Evolving his love for music in the years after, Stefan always remembered the hard pounding tracks, with huge melodic influences from that period.

After they started to work as a team, things went fast. All of their releases got huge feedback, and were played by all the major jocks, resulting in several bookings for the biggest parties hardstyle knows (for example: Qlimax, DefQon.1, Mysteryland, Decibel, Thrillogy, Reverze, Q-Base)

For a year Diederik and Stefan hosted the &#8220;Next Chapter&#8221;, a hardstyle label with some of the most popular releases, like: Keep it coming, Lockdown, Natte asbak and Guilty.

Nowadays they are the happy owners of the &#8220;Scantraxx Evolutionz&#8221;, a sublabel from the &#8220;Scantraxx&#8221; label which will bring you huge releases with one goal: to get every party started!

Olaf Veldkamp - DJ and Producer brought in by Dutch Master Works in 2009 to replace Henry Snijders who decided to leave the Dutch Master project.

2.
Dutch Master, aka Henry Snijders, is considered one of the biggest hard-style talents. At the age of 16 he was already a resident in a huge club in his hometown. The place where he developed his DJ Skills. Dutch Master became more and more attracted to play dance-music in the harder styles. Stimulated by his passion for music Henry began to live his dream of becoming a DJ and producer. He owns his own recording studio and works together with the guys of Showtek.

After two years Dutch Master delivered his first hard-style tracks: Insomnia and Get up, these tracks became the absolute club-bangers! Even DJ Luna called it the track of the year 2006. The track slammin&#8217; the bass is released on vinyl and on the album from Showtek. The track is also released on the Sensation black 2007 CD.

As a new upcoming man in hard-style it&#8217;s difficult to get your own little space. But the hard work he puts into his dream is paying of. He went on tour with Showtek around Europe and also played at X-Qlusive Zany. Dutch Master was also booked for Defqon1 2007 and Q-base.

After their first release &#8220;Save the Day&#8221;, which scored more than twenty compilations CDs, they immediately established their name in the Dutch dance scene. Their follow up &#8220;Controller&#8221; turned out to be one of everyone&#8217;s favourite hardstyle track, and Showtek became more and more popular in The Netherlands and in other countries.

Later they released their records in co-operation with ID&amp;T. This was a step forwards in the career for the two guys. So in March 2003 their record &#8220;Seid Ihr Bereid&#8221; was released on the Q-Dance/ID&amp;T label. Again a pounding track which is on every DJ&#8217;s playlist.

The two brothers are booked on big events and clubs all over the Netherlands (Sensation Black, Shockers, Qlubtempo, Hardbass Extreme, Loudness, Qlimax, Xxlerator), and they have a monthly residency in their hometown, which is a great success. But they are not only spinning records&#8230; They also have a blasting live act. Their latest track is &#8220;Puta Madre&#8221; in 2006. They recently cooperated with Gizmo and released &#8220;3 The Hard Way&#8221;, and created &#8220;Rockin Steady&#8221; with Deepack.

Besides their great teamwork as Showtek, they also have their own solo projects. The youngest brother, DJ Duro produced his first record &#8220;Again&#8221;.

He also spend many years playing drums in Brass Bands, which on the islands where specialized in Carnival music. This is where Randy acquired the Latin tribal soul that he projects in his music today.

Shortly after moving to Amsterdam in 1988, he started his own record company BPM Dance and opened one of the most successful online vinyl shops till this day: Only-Djs.com. After experiencing difficult times in the music industry, because of the free downloads, he decided to become a fulltime DJ. January 2003 he stopped the activities in the companies and by the end of the year he agreed to become resident DJ to, what was to become one of the hottest places in party history in Amsterdam, &#8220;Xtra Large&#8221; (Marcanti Plaza) and &#8220;Crazyland&#8221;. It took him only two years to make his first entry in the DJ Mag world top 100 list, in 2005, at number 150.

Currently Randy Katana is working on an album that will specifically project his unique style combining new material with special edits of floor fillers. The album was initially scheduled to be released in the end of 2006. But the dance scene changed so fast in this period that he decided to wait and see what direction it would go. 2007 is the year of the &#8220;Electro&#8221; sound.

With a newly-released debut album, &#8220;A Peek At Heaven Through Square Binoculars&#8221;, and an exuberant live presence, the band is headed feet-first to the top.

Mem&#8217;s musical style has changed significantly over the last three years. Having previously released two very electic EPs in &#8220;Equilibrium&#8221; (2004) and &#8220;5 to 6&#8221; (2005), mem have once again reinvented themselves with the refreshing take on lo-fi indie pop featured on their debut LP.

Mem&#8217;s existence has been characterized by its closely-knit cast of musicians. At the core of the band is singer/pianist/songwriter Grayson Sanders. The latest Mem line-up also comprises Alex Kveton (guitars, strings, vocals), Sam Greenfield (bass), Mike Morrill (drums, vocals), and Jonathan Koh (guitars, vocals).

Outgrowing local bingo halls to play with the big ballers of the game has been the result of their hard work and devotion. The Bingo Players appear to have been made for each other, the proof of which came in November 2009, when the DJ/producer duo topped the Beatport overall chart for a second time with their remake of the dance floor classic, &#8220;Devotion&#8221;, which stayed on no. 1 for two weeks and over a month in the top 10!

Back in 2008 the Bingo Players were still experiencing the extensive aftermath of their UHM &amp; Tony Flexx &#8211; &#8220;Our House&#8221; remix. The cooperation with Chocolate Puma on the legendary label Strictly Rhythm/Defected, &#8220;Touch Me&#8221; was released and gained support all over. If that wasn&#8217;t enough, it also hit Beatport&#8217;s chart number one position! &#8220;Touch Me&#8221; then appeared on various compilations, like Defected In The House and Sensation White.

After that, Dutch house mogul, ErickE&#8217;s &#8220;Wanna Go Again&#8221;, was treated with the inner Bingo and this remix hit the Dance Tunes top position and was inserted in the CD machines of Noir, Sander van Doorn and Patric La Funk amongst others. In September 2008 &#8220;Get Up&#8221; hit the shelves following a huge buzz and support from Laidback Luke, A Trak, Crookers and made it onto the 2008 I LOVE TECHNO! compilation, mixed by Boys Noize.

Thanks to high sales, LouLou Players have also remixed many tracks for labels like Darren Emerson, Fatphaze, Dahlback &amp; Ekenback, John Acquaviva, Remo feat Cheleonis R Jones, &#8230;

He carried on building on his success, and in 2005, again with Fabrice, he founded an independent electro label supported by Audiopolis Distribution. Called LouLou Records, Gregg uses the label to put out his tracks, with the artist name Kolombo, his new solo project.

Kolombo allows himself to put out a wider variety of sounds, from dark electro to minimal, while keeping his electro house feel throughout. He&#8217;s currently signing many tracks and remixes on labels like Strobe Music, Lektroklash, Color, Blu-Fin, Jackmoves, Dirty Dancing, Kitt Ball, Surprise, Artminimal and many more.

Since September 2006, Kolombo has joined Mugwump: a project where he produced music in collaboration with Geoffroy and Compuphonic. At the same time, he is managing to create a new record label with Marc Romboy from Systematic call &#8220;Vice versa Recordings&#8221;.
