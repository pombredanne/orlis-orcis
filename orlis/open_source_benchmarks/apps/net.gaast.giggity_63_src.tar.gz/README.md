# Giggity

Giggity is an Android app that loads
xcal/[Pentabarf](http://www.pentabarf.org/)/[frab](https://github.com/frab/frab)
XML files (that contain schedules of conferences/festivals/other events)
and lets you browse them in various convenient formats.

Nowadays many events release dedicated apps (sometimes with limited
features) which I don't like. :-( With Giggity I try to just offer a
generic app that can be used for any event that publishes their schedule
in an open format, and with maybe not a very pretty UI, but hopefully a
functional one.

It's free software, and available on [Google
Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.gaast.giggity&hl=en),
[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=net.gaast.giggity)
and I guess other Android markets.

It's named Giggity, after the word "Gig". The fact that it is also a
well-known catch phrase of a certain cartoon character may or may not be
coincidental. ;-)

## Using Giggity for your event

You can add any suitably formatted schedule to Giggity yourself (use QR
codes to make this easier), or it can be added to Giggity's main menu
(just e-mail me).

## Repository setup

This is an Android Studio project. Good luck getting your local install
to import it properly! It's a process that can either be enjoyable or
make me miss Makefiles, though it appears much less fragile than it was
with Eclipse?

Sadly Eclipse and Android Studio have done a great job at fscking up the
indentation (meant to be tabs but got mixed here and there). Maybe I'll
decrustify some day.. Please do use tabs.
