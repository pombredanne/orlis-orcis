# Diaspora for Android

This is an unofficial webview based client for the community-run, distributed social network **[Diaspora](https://joindiaspora.com/)**. It's currently under development and should be used with that in mind. Please submit any bugs you might find.  
**Notice:** This is the repo of the latest version of the unoffical Diaspora Android App.

- [Download App](https://github.com/Diaspora-for-Android/diaspora-android/releases)
- Watch [Changelog](https://github.com/Diaspora-for-Android/diaspora-android/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- See [Screenshots](https://github.com/Diaspora-for-Android/diaspora-android/blob/master/SCREENSHOTS.md)

## Contributions
We are always open for any kind of contribution. (PR's, bug reports, feature requests, ..)  
If you got any questions feel free to ask at [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Diaspora-for-Android/diaspora-android).  
Note that the main project members are mostly busy with their job/university/school and may not react or start coding immediately.

### License
It's released under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (see [LICENCE](https://github.com/Diaspora-for-Android/diaspora-android/blob/master/LICENSE.md)).

### Native
It's "native" because it's developed in Java + the Android SDK (Android Studio). Other Diaspora clients are developed using frameworks like AppCelerator Titanium. A native app will always be more efficient and almost certainly be faster and make better use of the resources of the device.

### "WebApp"
It's a WebApp because at this moment Diaspora doesn't have an API that can be used to create a native interface to retrieve the user's data, publications, direct messages and so on, that's why there are only WebApps for Diaspora out there.
Why a WebApp is better than using the mobile site on a browser? Basically it provides better integration with the system (events coming into and going out of the app), notifications, customized interface and functions and a nice little icon that takes you directly to your favorite social network :)

### Device Requirements
The minimum version supported is Ice Cream Sandwitch, Android version 4.0.3 (or API 15)

### App Permissions
It requires access to the Internet and to external storage to be able to upload photos when creating a new post and for taking screenshots.
