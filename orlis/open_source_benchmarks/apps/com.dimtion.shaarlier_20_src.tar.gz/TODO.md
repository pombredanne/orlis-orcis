I know, a todo file is not always

## To do ASAP
- Feature : Handle redirection (E.g : shaarli.fr)
- Bug : autocomplete field for tags is hidden by keyboard when a description is too long (help needed!)

## Planned for future releases
- Save link in a draft in case of an error
- Nicer UI

## Q&A
- Try app on as many apps as possible
- Try more device screen sizes
- Try in low network conditions
- Try on slow devices

## Long term evolutions (if requested)
- See online Shaarli links
- Save link later
- Try to stay KISS
