# Shaarlier

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/grade/6228d636f0e44708b2739a35e8b9a2b0)](https://www.codacy.com/app/zizou-xena/Shaarlier)

A simple app for sharing links on your Shaarli.

## Features
- Publish links on your Shaarli
- Automatically add a title and a description to your links (as Shaarli does)
- Optional dialog box for editing title, description or tags
- Multiple Shaarlis

## Planned features
See [TODO file](https://github.com/dimtion/Shaarlier/blob/master/TODO.md) for a detailed roadmap.

## Downloads
- From the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dimtion.shaarlier)
- From the [release tab](https://github.com/dimtion/Shaarlier/releases)
- From the [Aptoide Store](http://dimtion.store.aptoide.com/app/market/com.dimtion.shaarlier/8/8917968/Shaarlier)
- From [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=shaarlier&fdid=com.dimtion.shaarlier)

## Why ?
I made this app because the official one doesn't feels right to me, in some cases you just need to save a link for reading it later. So launching the browser for that only task is quite too long (you know, I like when things are fast and easy).
