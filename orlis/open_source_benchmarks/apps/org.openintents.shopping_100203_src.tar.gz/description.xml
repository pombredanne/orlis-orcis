        <short-description>OI Shopping List lets you keep track of your shopping items</short-description>
        <full-description>OI Shopping List is a powerful application which makes it easy to create and manage
          checklists. OI Shopping List makes it easy to add items to a list, check the item off, and remove it from the
          list. The application can track separate prices for each store that you use, and features a high level of
          customization. Font size, sort order, list columns, and list cleanup behavior are all settings controlled by
          the user. All of these features are brought together in a crisp layout that is customizable through a variety
          of themes.
