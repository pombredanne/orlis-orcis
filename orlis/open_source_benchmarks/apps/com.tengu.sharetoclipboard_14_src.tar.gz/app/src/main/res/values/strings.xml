    <string name="about_content">Copy to clipboard straight from the Android \"Share\" menu.\n\nNo more annoying workarounds to do something that is so useful and essential.\n\n<b>How to use:</b> just open any app, for example the browser, press \"Share\", and choose \"Share to Clipboard\". Now just go to any text field, long-press, and in the pop-up menu click \"Paste\". That is it!\n\nUnique to this app is that we also support sharing VCards (contact) and plan on adding many others.\n\nAlso, unlike many other solutions, this one doesn\'t have any visual bugs and phantom windows, just click share to copy from any app, and paste anywhere you like!\n\nThanks to many contributors, the app is available in many languages.\n\n\nFully open source, with source code available at:\nhttps://github.com/tengusw/share_to_clipboard\nIf you are a developer, contributions are welcome!\n\nPlease let us know about any issues, preferably by email (android@tengu.it).</string>
