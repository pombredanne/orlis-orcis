        <h1>Welcome to CAdroid!</h1>
        
        <p>CAdroid is intended to assist you in importing your own CA or self-signed certificate
        to your Android device.</p>
        
        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        
        <p>After you enter the host name of your HTTPS site, the certificate chain will be
        fetched and you can select the root certificate to import. Possible import issues
        will be detected and displayed.</p>

        <p>As soon as you have verified the certificate by its details and fingerprints,
        it will be exported into a .crt file. You can then simply import the certificate from the file with a few clicks.</p>
        
        <p>When the certificate was imported correctly, it will be accepted in (nearly) all
        apps, including <a href="https://davdroid.bitfire.at">DAVdroid</a> and the
        Android email app (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=67038">don\'t
        choose \"Accept all certificates\" there</a>).</p>

        <p>X.509 v3+ certificates may contain the Basic Constraints extension.
        It contains a CA flag and optionally, a path length constraint. Android will only accept CA certificates when they have a CA flag set to TRUE.
        Otherwise, it\'s assumed that this CA mustn\'t issue certificates, not even for itself (self-signed).</p>
        <p><b>There\'s no CA flag=TRUE in this certificate, so Android can\'t import it.</b> Trying so wouldn\'t result
        in an error message, but the certificate wouldn\'t appear in the list and wouldn\'t be trusted.</b></p>
        <p>Solution: Set the CA flag to TRUE when using a self-signed certificate.</p>

        <p>The certificate has been stored on your "external storage". Now you can import it to
        your Android device using Android Settings (Security):</p>
        
        <p>1. Click \"Open Settings\" to open Android Settings.</p>
        <p>2. Scroll down to \"Credential Storage\".</p>
        <p>3. Use \"Install from SD card\" (the exact term may differ) and follow the instructions.</p>
        <p>Note 1: You may have to set up a PIN or password for the lock screen
        (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=31101">Android bug #31101</a>).</p>
        <p>Note 2: On Android 4.4+, there will be a strange \"Network may be monitored\" warning
        (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=62644">Android bug #62644</a>).</p>
        
        <p>4. After installing the certificate, you can verify whether it worked by using \"Trusted credentials
        (Display trusted CA certificates)\" in Settings (Security). Your CA should appear in the \"User\"
        tab.</p>
