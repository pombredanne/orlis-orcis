    <string name="markdown_text">&lt;i>"On diaspora* it's possible to format your text in status messages, comments
        and conversations using a simplified mark-up system called Markdown. This page gives an introduction to the
        codes used to create this formatting.&lt;/i>&lt;br> &lt;br>

        &lt;b>Heading&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        # This is an extremely large header&lt;br>
        ## Half as big as the one above&lt;br>
        ### Twice the size of normal text&lt;br> &lt;br>

        &lt;b>Italics and bold&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        Italics: *word* or _word_&lt;br>
        Bold: **word** or __word__&lt;br>
        Bold italics: ***word*** or ___word___&lt;br> &lt;br>

        &lt;b>Bulleted list&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        *, + or - in front of each line you want as part of the list or 1., 2., etc. in front of the list items&lt;br> &lt;br>

        &lt;b>Quotation&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        When you want to quote an extract of an article or another comment, you can conveniently format your text by starting the
        line or the paragraph by the > character&lt;br> &lt;br>

        &lt;b>Horizontal line&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        To create a horizontal line, use at least three - - -, _ _ _ or * * * on a separate line. Any number above three will do
        the same thing and spaces between the characters do not matter.&lt;br> &lt;br>

        &lt;b>Inline link&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        [displayed text here](http://link.address.here \"alt text\") The 'alt text' is optional, and is displayed as a tool-tip
        when the cursor is moved over the link.&lt;br> &lt;br>

        &lt;b>External images&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        ![Alt text](http://website.com/image.jpg \"optional title\") The alternative text in the square brackets is displayed if the image cannot be loaded, and the optional title is displayed as a tool-tip when the cursor is moved over the image; both are useful but not essential.&lt;br> &lt;br>

        &lt;b>Escape&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        If you want your message to include a character which is also used in Markdown coding, you can prevent it from being read by Markdown as a formatting code by 'escaping' it. To do this, place a backslash in front of the character. You can, however, type 'diaspora*' or 'D*' without the asterisk becoming a formatting code!&lt;br> &lt;br>

        &lt;b>Special characters&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        You can create the following symbols and other special characters using a combination of characters:&lt;br>
        (c) = © ; (r) = ® ; x^2 = x²"</string>
