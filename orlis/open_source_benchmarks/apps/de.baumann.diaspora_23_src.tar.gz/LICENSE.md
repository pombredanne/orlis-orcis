First of all: I am not a developer. I understand a few basics and most of my work is done
by copy and paste. This app is a fork of the original [Diaspora-Native-Webapp](https://github.com/martinchodev/Diaspora-Native-WebApp)
from "martinchodev" (who did most of the work -> big thanks to him), which is released under the GPL-license.
