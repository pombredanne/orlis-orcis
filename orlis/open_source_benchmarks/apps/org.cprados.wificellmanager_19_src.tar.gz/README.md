Wi-Fi Matic Android App
=======================

- What is Wi-Fi Matic?

Wi-Fi Matic is and Android app that activates and deactivates Wi-Fi of your device automatically depending on your location, helping you to save battery and consumption of data through your operator network.

It detects automatically the location of known Wi-Fi networks (f.i: home, office, etc.), turns on W-Fi when you arrive a place where there is Wi-Fi, and turns it off when you leave.

You will simply notice that your device automatically uses Wi-Fi in the usual places where you have Wi-Fi access, while it keeps Wi-Fi off where you don't have it.

- How does it work?

It DOES NOT USE GPS neither requires to have Android network location services enabled, as it uses your operator network cell identifiers (cell tower identifiers) as the relative location where you are, and where your Wi-Fi networks are. It is designed to minimize usage of resources and battery. 

Wi-Fi Matic detects and learns automatically locations where you are connected to a Wi-Fi, and doesn't need configuration. Besides, it allows you to manage manually your Wi-Fi when needed not interfering with you or with your device data connections.
