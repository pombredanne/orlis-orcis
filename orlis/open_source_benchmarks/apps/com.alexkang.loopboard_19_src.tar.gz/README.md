[SPRING 2014] LoopBoard
=======================

Dynamic, customizable soundboard for Android. Record sound clips and play them back or loop them.

Currently, the application can record sounds through the microphone (or use sounds from internal storage!) and play them back through a newly created button. Each button has the option to re-record and loop playback.
