    <string name="hello">ReGeX /ˈrɛːɡɛx/ is an android game, with a simple objective: Find a
        regular expression which does match certain strings, but doesn\'t match others.\n\n

        Depending on how long the expression is, how many regex characters you used and a few
        more variables, your score is generated. From the number of game and your score (high
        score and less games), the current level is calculated. The higher the level, the more
        complex the challenges become. There is no last or final level - it just goes on forever
        growing square-root-like.\n\n

        Below I have added a link to a cheat-sheet on regular expression, for those unfamiliar
        with the syntax.\n\n
