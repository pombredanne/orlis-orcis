A front/rear camera with flash.

This is a camera useable for simple photo taking and video recording. It can switch between front and rear camera, and the flash can be turned on and off. While recording a video, the flash can be used as a flashlight. Does not require any unnecessary permissions needed by many other cameras. You can activate the shutter by long pressing the preview for easier selfies.

If you want to launch this app at pressing the hardware camera button, you might have to disable the built in Camera app in Settings -> Apps -> Camera -> Disable.
