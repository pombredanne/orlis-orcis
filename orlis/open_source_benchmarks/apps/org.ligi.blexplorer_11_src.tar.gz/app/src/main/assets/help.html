    I was developing it because I wanted to develop an app for the crafty and needed to copy some service and characteristic uuids - there was no open-source
    BLE explorer which I could extend with this feature. So I started developing this app. It is free-software -
    the <a href="http://github.com/ligi/BLExplorer">source is on GitHub</a>
